HW 3: State Design Pattern Implementation

Overview

This project demonstrates the State design pattern using a code compiler scenario. The State pattern is used to manage the different states of a code compilation process, such as parsing, code generation, and optimization. The compiler's behavior changes dynamically based on its current state.

Application Context

In this application, we consider a simple code compiler that processes source code through various stages: parsing, code generation, and optimization. Each stage represents a different state of the compiler, and the behavior of the compiler changes depending on its current state.

Implementation Details

Key Components

1. CodeGenerator: The main class that manages the compilation process and state transitions.
2. CompilerState: Interface defining the common methods that all states should implement.
3. Concrete States: Implement the behavior associated with a particular state of the compiler (e.g., ParsingState, CodeGenerationState, OptimizationState).
4. CodeGenerationState: Handles the code generation phase of the compilation process.

State Transitions

- ParsingState: The compiler parses the source code.
-CodeGenerationState: The compiler generates intermediate or target code.
- OptimizationState**: The compiler optimizes the generated code.

Code Structure

- CodeGenerator.java: Contains the CodeGenerator class and its state management logic.
- CompilerState.java: Interface defining the state methods.
- **ParsingState.java, CodeGenerationState.java, OptimizationState.java: Concrete state implementations.
- Main.java: Contains the main method to run the compilation process and handle state transitions.

How the State Design Pattern is Implemented

1. Dynamic State Changes: The compiler's state changes dynamically based on the current phase of the compilation process. For example, after parsing, the compiler transitions to the CodeGenerationState.
2. State-Dependent Behaviors: Each state (Parsing, CodeGeneration, Optimization) implements its own behavior. For instance, in CodeGenerationState, the compiler generates code based on the parsed input.

Test Code

The test code simulates the compilation process and verifies that the compiler's state changes correctly and that the corresponding behaviors are executed.

Ant Script

An Ant build script (build.xml) is provided to compile and run the project. Use the following commands:

- ant compile: Compiles the source code.
- ant run: Runs the main application.
- ant test: Runs the test cases.

Conclusion

This project effectively demonstrates the State design pattern by managing the behavior of a code compiler through state transitions. The implementation ensures that the compiler's actions are context-dependent and dynamically changeable based on the current phase of the compilation process.
